## Recipe 1: Creamy Florentine Chicken over Rice

This is a classic "skillet" style meal where the sauce is the star.

### Ingredients:

* Chicken
* Spinach
* Heavy Cream
* Rice

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Rice:** Rinse the rice and cook it according to package instructions (usually a 2:1 water-to-rice ratio). Set aside.
2. **Sear the Chicken:** Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. In a large pan over medium-high heat, sear the chicken until golden brown and cooked through. Remove chicken from the pan and set aside.
3. **Make the Cream Sauce:** Reduce heat to medium. Pour the heavy cream into the same pan, scraping up any browned bits from the chicken. Let it simmer for 2–3 minutes until it begins to thicken slightly.
4. **Wilt the Spinach:** Add a large handful of spinach to the cream. Stir until the spinach has wilted into the sauce.
5. **Combine:** Add the chicken back into the sauce. Toss to coat and let everything simmer together for 1 minute.
6. **Serve:** Spoon the creamy chicken and spinach mixture generously over a bed of fluffy rice.

## Recipe 2: One-Pot "Lazy" Creamy Chicken Risotto

This method cooks everything together so the rice absorbs the cream and chicken juices.

### Ingredients:

* Chicken
* Rice
* Heavy Cream
* Spinach

### Instructions:

1. **Brown the Chicken:** Cut chicken into small cubes and brown them in a pot.
2. **Toast the Rice:** Add the dry rice to the pot with the chicken and stir for 1 minute to lightly toast the grains.
3. **Simmer:** Add water (standard amount for your rice) and a splash of the heavy cream. Cover and simmer on low heat until the rice is nearly tender.
4. **The Finish:** Stir in the remaining heavy cream and the spinach. Fold gently until the spinach is wilted and the rice looks thick and "risotto-like."
5. **Rest:** Turn off the heat and let it sit covered for 2 minutes before serving.

## 💡 Expert Tips & Substitutions

* **Seasoning:** Since we are sticking strictly to your list, ensure you use **salt and pepper** (kitchen staples) liberally. If you have garlic or onion powder in the pantry, they would be excellent additions to the chicken while browning.
* **The Rice:** If you find the rice too plain, use a small amount of the heavy cream in the boiling water to give it a richer, "pillowy" texture.
* **Variations:** If you have any butter or parmesan cheese hiding in the fridge, adding them to the sauce in Recipe 1 will create an even deeper flavor profile.
