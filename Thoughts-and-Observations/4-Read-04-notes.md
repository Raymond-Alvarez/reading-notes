# Building the Internet's Skeleton

Hey there! If you’ve ever wondered what’s actually happening behind the scenes of your favorite website, it all starts with **HTML**, or **HyperText Markup Language**. Think of it as the basic building block of the web that defines the structure and meaning of everything you see on a screen.

#### **Planning with Wireframes**

Before developers even start typing code, they often create **wireframes**. These are simple, **black-and-white diagrams** used to plan the "information hierarchy" of a page. By stripping away colors, fancy fonts, and images, designers can focus on **simplicity and clarity**, ensuring that a user can navigate the site easily without being distracted by aesthetics. It is much easier (and cheaper!) to change a hand-drawn sketch than it is to fix code later on.

#### **How HTML Works**

HTML works by "marking up" content using **elements**. You essentially wrap your text or images in special **tags** to tell the browser what that content is—like a paragraph, a heading, or a link. While most elements act like containers for text, others allow us to embed **multimedia** like images, audio, and video directly into a page.

#### **Meaning Matters: Semantics**

A big part of modern web design is using **semantic elements**. This means choosing tags based on the **meaning of the data** rather than just how it looks. For example, instead of just making text big and bold, we use a specific heading tag to tell the computer, "This is the most important title on the page".

### **Frequently Asked Questions**

**What is HTML and why do we use it?**
**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the fundamental code used to **structure a web page** and its content. We use it to define the **meaning and structure** of web content, such as identifying what is a paragraph, a list, or a data table. While other languages like CSS handle the look and JavaScript handles the behavior, HTML provides the essential foundation.

**What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?**
Most HTML elements consist of:

1. An **opening tag** (e.g., `<body>`).
2. The **content** (the text or information inside).
3. A **closing tag** (e.g., `</body>`).

- Note: Some "void" elements, like `<img>`, do not have content or a closing tag.*

**What is it called when you give an element extra information?**
Extra information or settings provided to an element are called **attributes**. Attributes are additional values that **configure the element** or adjust its behavior in various ways, such as the `src` attribute which tells an image element where its file is located.

**What is a semantic element?**
A **semantic element** is a tag that clearly **communicates its meaning** to both the browser and the developer. Instead of just being a generic container, a semantic element like `<article>`, `<nav>`, or `<footer>` describes the **purpose** of the content it holds. Using these elements is vital for **SEO** (search engine optimization) and **accessibility**, as it helps screen readers navigate the page for visually impaired users.

**Analogy for Understanding HTML**
Think of a web page like a **house**. **HTML** is the **framing and blueprint**: it defines where the kitchen is, where the front door goes, and where the load-bearing walls are. **Wireframing** is the initial **pencil sketch** the architect makes to see if the layout makes sense. Without the HTML "frame," you wouldn't have a place to put the "paint" (CSS) or the "electricity" (JavaScript)!
