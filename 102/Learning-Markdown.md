# Learning Markdown

### <u>Markdown</u>

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language used to add formatting to plain-text documents and has become one of the most widely used markup languages.  
Markdown uses simple syntax that remains readable even in its plain-text form.

### <u>Why Use Markdown?</u>

- **Portability:** Markdown files can be opened by almost any application and aren’t locked behind proprietary formats.
- **Platform Independence:** Works on any device or operating system.
- **Future-Proofing:** Even if a Markdown app becomes unavailable, the text remains readable in any text editor.
- **Ubiquity:** Supported by GitHub, Reddit, documentation tools, note apps, and more.
- **Versatility:** Used for documents, websites, books, notes, presentations, emails, and technical documentation.

### <u>Headings in Markdown</u>

To create a heading, add number signs (`#`) before your text.

**Largest heading:**  

- `# Heading 1`
  - (one `#`)

**Smallest heading:**

- `###### Heading 6`
  - (six `#`)

---

### <u>Emphasis (Bold & Italics)</u>

For maximum compatibility, especially inside words, use **asterisks**, one `*` for *italic* and two `**` for **bold**: 

`*italic text*`

- *italic text*

`**bold text**`
  
- **bold text**

### <u>Links in Markdown</u>

Use bracketed text followed by the URL in parentheses.

Example:  
`[Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com)`

You can add an optional title:  
`[Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "Search Engine")`

---

### <u>Unordered Lists</u>

You can use any of the following symbols:

- Dash: `-`
- Asterisk: `*`
- Plus: `+`

**Best practice:** Pick one and use it consistently.
